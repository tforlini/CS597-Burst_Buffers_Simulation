This example program shows some features enabled by the new annotation-based
configuration and mapping APIs in codes-base, as well as support for them in
codes-net. The example does not exhaustively show all new features added - for
more details, see configuration.h, codes-mapping.h, and model-net.h in
codes-net.

Specifically, some features shown are:
* Use of annotated configuration to initialize three separate network models.
  Note that they are all the same network model, just with different
  parameterizations. This includes both the configuration file itself as well as
  interaction in the code between components with different annotations.
* Addressing at various levels in both LP type-specific namespaces and
  model-net namespaces (network id, annotation tuples).
* The updated registration/configuration sequence in main.
