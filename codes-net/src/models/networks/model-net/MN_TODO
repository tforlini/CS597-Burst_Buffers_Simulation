1- Torus model integration, possible additions:
- Allow some compute nodes to be idle (not mapped to a server) i.e. we can specify any number of server and torus nodes that we want in the config file. 
The torus configuration parameters should set an upper bound on the number of servers/compute nodes.
- Change the buffer overflow message? May be allow a slowed down packet injection rate if the buffer overflows and report the average injection rate at the
end of the simulation.
