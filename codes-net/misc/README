== ptrn_loggp-2.4.6.patch

If you are using the most recent version of netgauge at the time of this
writing, 2.4.6, to gather loggp parameters, then you will likely need this patch
to get the results you expect. This version replaced the exponential message
size progression with fixed, linear byte increments of 1K. The patch reverts
this new behavior.
